    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I’m a sophomore at UC Berkeley studying computer science. 
        I’ve been taking computer science course since high school, 
        and am comfortable coding in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        I’m also currently learning React, and a few other languages. Outside of class, 
        I’m working in graphic design. I also love writing and producing music! Some of my 
        other hobbies include rock climbing, surfing, hiking, and anything else in nature. </p>
